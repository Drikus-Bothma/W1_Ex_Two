    <h1>Cockatiel</h1>
    <p>The single species of Nymphicus is the cockatiel. The cockatiel was originally classified as either a little cockatoo or a crested parakeet, but more recent DNA research have given it its own subfamily, Nymphicinae. As a result, it is presently considered to be the smallest subfamily of the Cacatuidae (cockatoo family). Australia is home to cockatiels, which prefer the country's wetlands, scrublands, and bushlands.</p>
